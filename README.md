![Microcks Testcontainers Spring demo](./assets/microcks-testcontainers-java-spring-demo.png)

This application is a demonstration on how to integrate Microcks via [Testcontainers]([https://www.testcontainers.com]) within your development inner-loop.

You will work with a Spring Boot application and explore how to:
* Use Microcks for **provisioning third-party API mocks**,
* Use Microcks for **simulating external Kafka events publishers**,
* Write tests using Microcks **contract-testing** features for both **REST/OpenAPI based APIs and Events/AsyncAPI** based messaging
